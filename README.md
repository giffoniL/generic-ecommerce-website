# generic-ecommerce-website

Website project of a ecommerce website with the usual features, Spring Framework on the backend and Javascript / HTML / SCSS on the front, using server side rendering through Thymeleaf. Very much a work in progress, will update as it nears completion.

Design taken from [here]((https://wpastra.com/templates/generic-ecommerce-02/), but no HTML/CSS is taken other than font families, colors, and pictures. I'm bad at designing and the focus of this project is the programming, not the designing.
